# Evolving Stability: Drone-Pole Control with LQR & Genetic Algorithms

This project tackles the classic, notoriously difficult challenge of balancing an inverted pendulum, but with a modern twist: the pendulum is mounted on a quadcopter drone. Control is achieved using a **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**, whose critical Q and R matrices are intelligently fine-tuned by a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to discover the optimal balancing strategy.

The result is a robust, self-tuning control system brought to life in a versatile Python simulation environment.

## üß† The Core Concepts

-   **The Challenge: The Inverted Pendulum**
    A classic problem in control theory, balancing a pole is inherently unstable. The drone must make constant, precise adjustments to counteract gravity and disturbances, making it a perfect testbed for advanced control algorithms.

-   **The Controller: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**
    LQR is an optimal control technique that determines the best possible adjustments by minimizing a cost function. This function penalizes both state deviations (e.g., the pole's angle) and control effort (e.g., the drone's motor thrust). The key is choosing the right penalty matrices, `Q` (for state) and `R` (for effort).

-   **The Optimizer: Genetic Algorithm (GA)**
    How do we find the *best* `Q` and `R` matrices? This is where the GA comes in. By simulating a population of controllers and applying principles of evolution‚Äîselection, crossover, and mutation‚Äîthe algorithm iteratively "evolves" the LQR parameters towards optimal performance, discovering highly effective and sometimes non-obvious balancing strategies.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **GA-Tuned LQR Controller**: A powerful combination for solving complex control problems.
-   **Multi-System Simulation**: Includes pre-configured models for a **Drone-Pole**, a classic **Cart-Pole**, and a standalone **Drone**.
-   **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly interface built with `CustomTkinter` for both training new models and testing existing ones.
-   **Modular Configuration**: Easily define and customize your own physical systems and training parameters.
-   **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Load and simulate multiple systems simultaneously to compare their performance visually.

</center>

#### Workflow:

1.  **Select a System** (`Drone-Pole`, `Cart-Pole`, etc.) from the dropdown.
2.  **Choose a Configuration File** containing the pre-trained weights.
3.  **Give it a Name** for the simulation list.
4.  Click **Load Data**. You can load multiple systems to compare.
5.  Click **Simulate** to launch the visualization window.


#### In the Simulation Window:

#### Workflow:

1.  **Select System Type** and a **Source File** to use as a template.
2.  Enter an **Output Filename** where the new trained model will be saved.
3.  **Fetch** the template data.
4.  **Choose What to Change** (`GA Config`, `Train Config`, or `System Config`).
5.  **Modify** the parameters directly in the text box.
6.  **Save** your changes and click **Train** to begin.
7.  The GUI will close, and progress will be printed to the terminal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration Structure

Each system is defined by a `.bin` file containing a list of Python dictionaries. This structure allows for easy customization and extension.

```python
# Located in: SOURCE/DATA/your_system.bin

[
    # Genetic Algorithm settings
    ga_config = {
        "max_steps": 1000,      # Max simulation steps per evaluation
        "goal": [0, 0, 0, 0],  # Target state for the system
        "pop_size": 50,         # Number of individuals per generation
        # ... and other GA parameters
    },

    # Training session settings
    train_conf = {
        "num_gen": 100,         # Number of generations to evolve
        "cross_prob": 0.8,      # Crossover probability
        "mut_prob": 0.1,        # Mutation probability
    },

    # Physical properties of the system
    sys_config = {
        "mass_pole": 0.5,
        "length_pole": 1.0,
        "mass_drone": 1.5,
        # ... and other physical constants
    }
